Among all user interactions in October 2019, nearly 40.8 million product views were recorded.
Out of these, only 2.27% led to an item being added to the cart, and 1.82% resulted in an actual purchase.
However, once an item was in the cart, the purchase rate was surprisingly high: over 80%, indicating that users who commit to cart are very likely to complete the purchase.
